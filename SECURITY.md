## Reporting a Vulnerability

v1.0 and v2.0 may contain real-time detection vulnerabilities and incorrect recognition and results may vary due to differences in background, lighting, dynamic dataset and various other factors.
Updated models are hence provided to address all these issues.

In cases of any vulnerability, report issues here or contact any of the contributors for further assistance.
We welcome your feedback! Please submit any issues or share your thoughts on how we can continue improving the ISL Translation project.
