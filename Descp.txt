Here now in this update, we can now create a custom data set or create one by each user for different regions, by taking hand signs from the user and saving the corresponding word for it by passing the name in cmd which creates a folder in the data folder which contains the dataset (Data collection and naming). We now extract the keypoints or hand marks from these 10 frames of the image dataset that we collected using mediapipe and convert the keypoints into npy arrays. Further we pass these arrays in our new random forest model which is a better choice of model. upon training and saving this model we now use it in real time for sign language recognition in the desired language and correctly detect hindi words rapidly and accurately which is much better than previous english letters model which was slow and not that accurate.
